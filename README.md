<h1>Most Important Design Patterns</h1>

<p>In This Project I've Demonstrated The 7 Most Important Design Patterns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Singleton</li>
</ul>

<h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p>In This Pattern We Should Only Have One Instance Of A Class So For Doing That<br/> 
We Make Our Class's Constructor Private And We Make A Static Instance From <br/>Our Class And 
A Static Method For Returning That Static Instance.</p>
