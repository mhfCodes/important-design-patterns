<h1>Most Important Design Patterns</h1>

<p>In This Project I've Demonstrated The 7 Most Important Design Patterns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Singleton</li>
	<li>Factory</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p>In This Pattern We Should Only Have One Instance Of A Class So For Doing That<br/> 
We Make Our Class's Constructor Private And We Make A Static Instance From <br/>Our Class And 
A Static Method For Returning That Static Instance.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Factory Pattern</h2>
<p>In This Pattern We Create Objects Without Specifying The Exact Class Of The Object<br/>
 To Be Created. To Accomplish This, Objects Are Created By Calling A Factory Method Instead<br/>
 Of Calling A Constructor And We Refer To Newly Created Object Using A Common Interface.</p>
